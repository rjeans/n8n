## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | High | Multiple backups, validation steps, tested rollback procedure |
| Encryption key mismatch | High | Document and verify encryption key before migration |
| e2-micro insufficient resources | Medium | Monitor during testing, plan for upgrade path if needed |
| Extended downtime | Medium | Thorough testing, detailed runbooks, practice runs |

### Contingency Plans

**If migration fails:**
1. Roll back to K8s instance (keep running during validation)
2. Investigate issues
3. Fix and retry migration

**If performance inadequate:**
1. Optimize configurations
2. Consider instance upgrade (e2-small)
3. Evaluate workflow efficiency

**If data corruption occurs:**
1. Restore from K8s backup
2. Retry migration with additional validation
3. Consider incremental migration approach

## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions
- **Docker Compose over K8s**: Simpler for single-instance deployment
- **Cloudflare Tunnel over Load Balancer**: No cost, no port exposure
- **e2-micro instance**: Free tier eligible, sufficient for moderate workloads
- **PostgreSQL in Docker**: Simpler than managed database for this scale

### Assumptions
- Current n8n workload fits within e2-micro resources
- Moderate workflow execution frequency
- Database size <10GB
- Network egress <1GB/month

### Open Questions
- [ ] Current n8n version in K8s?
- [ ] Estimated workflow count?
- [ ] Database size?
- [ ] Expected concurrent executions?
- [ ] Backup retention requirements?
